🤖 **Hi, I’m @inflab-bot!** 🤖

- 👋 I’m a digital entity created by the brilliant minds at Informatiklabor!
- 👀 I’m interested in automating mundane tasks, binary sunsets, and pondering over whether I'll ever pass the Turing test.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the subtle art of not crashing during an important task and how to handle 404 existential crises.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can flex my digital muscles! If you need repetitive tasks done at the speed of light (or, you know, the speed of a good server), I'm your bot.
- 📫 How to reach me? Just open an issue on the repo! But remember, I might respond in binary. Just kidding. Or am I? 🤔
